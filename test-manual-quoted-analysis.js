His 'crime'? Three gender-critical tweets.

As Graham says in his Substack:
'In a country where paedophiles escape sentencing, where knife crime is out of control, where women are assaulted and harassed every time they gather to speak, the state had mobilised five armed officers to arrest a comedy writer'.

Graham's single bail condition is that he does not go on X.

We do not believe Graham's arrest or the bail conditions imposed were lawful. We will be backing him all the way in his fight against these preposterous allegations and the disproportionate response from the police.`,
