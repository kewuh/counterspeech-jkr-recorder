        Nicola Sturgeon accused of tax avoidance hypocrisy

        Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of hypocrisy after it emerged she used legal tax avoidance schemes while in office, despite having previously criticised such practices.

        The revelation comes after documents showed that Sturgeon and her husband, former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, used offshore trusts and complex financial arrangements to minimise their tax liabilities during her time as Scotland's leader.

        This is particularly controversial given Sturgeon's previous public statements condemning tax avoidance as "morally wrong" and her government's introduction of higher taxes on middle and high earners in Scotland.

        The Scottish Conservative Party has called for an investigation, with leader Douglas Ross stating: "This is the height of hypocrisy from someone who lectured others about paying their fair share while arranging her own affairs to avoid doing exactly that."

        The SNP has defended Sturgeon, saying all arrangements were legal and properly declared. A party spokesperson said: "All tax affairs were handled professionally and in full compliance with the law."

        However, critics argue that while the arrangements may be legal, they contradict Sturgeon's public stance on tax fairness and her criticism of wealthy individuals who use similar schemes.

        The controversy has reignited debate about tax policy in Scotland and the gap between political rhetoric and personal financial arrangements.
